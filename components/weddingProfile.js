        It all started in early December 2018 when I met this beautiful lady in the University of Buea as I went to visit a friend and we were taking a stroll. It was through a friend, his name; Ebot Carl and also later through Arreyvite Tambe. Seeing them talk with her, and how she responded & behaved, made me want to know her more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I was already based in Douala, fortunately for me the next time they came to Douala, they came along with her, also as the socio-political crisis was raging in the South west. They visited me with her twice when I got to know her better and spoke to her several times. We got to know each other and exchanged contacts. We felt comfortable with each other and got into a relationship towards the end of December 2018.

          <p>
            Through out the time of our relationship in 2019, we got to understand each other better and faced a reasonable share of challenges as we tried to dream big. As we faced criticisms too, we saw opportunities to keep trying to carve our own path. In 2021, we had our daughter Eneketa Mayuk, and she came in, to completely rehsape our relationship and re-orient us as to our next steps. With her coming, we realised a lot of successes in our plans and we kept finding ways to resolve our minor issues while staying together.
          </p>
          <p>
            We focused more on trying to have a solid financial foundation for our family rather than getting married first, and making it legal. An action that drew sharp criticism from family and friends. However, we understood the principle of the family being two people willing to defend each other against all forms of criticism and believing in each other. It was a big risk for both of us too since we could face a break up if we lost interest in each other. However, we kept finding value in each other. We made a reasonable financial breakthrough in 2021 through some investments in financial assets. Instead of getting married, we decided to informally start a small consultancy business and a baby accessories supply business overseen by each of us individually, but jointly owned. The criticisms kept coming for we showed little signs of financial growth but were unable make our union official. We decided to incorporate our consultancy business instead and to handle the criticism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally in 2024, I knew I wanted to move ahead to making it official. I looked at using her birthday Jan 29, 2024 but failed due to time constraints. Therefore, August 31st my birthday was the only othe reasonable opportunity. We gathered friends at Mayuka Residence (Ancienne route), a day when she said yes to marrying me and now, we look forward to officially celebrating with you on April 25 & 26, 2025.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have several plans for the future and we look forward to God as we hope to work together to grow even more. We wish to thank everyone who has always been by us and we love you all.
